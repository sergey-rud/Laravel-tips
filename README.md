### Laravel tips, Development pattern

* All models should be placed in “models” folder
* Each class, method and property should have phpDoc description
* Class description should contains only **magic** fields and methods
* Each DB migration script should have Table Engine declaration
* Strings should be placed in single quotes instead of double quotes for both PHP and JavaScript. HTML attributes and CSS should use double quotes only.
* Classes and methods shouldn’t be used in the Views
* Model method shouldn’t use global scope, eg $_SESSION, $_SERVER, $_COOKIE, etc. Please use Controllers to retrieve such info and pass it to Model method **as arguments**.

Bad example:
```php
class UploadHandler
{
    public function upload($filename)
    {
        
        //uploading file
        //...
        //end uploading file
        
        //save log
        $log = new UploadLog();
        $log->user()->associate(Auth::user()); // it's sad
        $log->filename = $filename;
        $log->save();
    }
}
```
Good example:
```php
class UploadHandler
{
    public function upload($filename, $user) // new argument here
    {

        //uploading file
        //...
        //end uploading file

        //save log
        $log = new UploadLog();
        $log->user()->associate($user); // now it's cool
        $log->filename = $filename;
        $log->save();
    }
}
```
